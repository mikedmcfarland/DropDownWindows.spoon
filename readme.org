* ideas
** serialize settings
persist configurations across reloads, (then everything could be configured)
[[https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.settings.html][Hammerspoon docs: hs.settings]]

** sepearate window state into module
consider serpating window state completely, maybe using
[[https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.watchable.html][Hammerspoon docs: hs.watchable]]
